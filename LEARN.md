# Solana development 101: Building a calculator using Solana programs

Welcome to the Solana crypto-currency quest. With this quest you'll get upto speed with the most rapidly rising blockchain in the market: *Solana*. It would be awesome if you know a bit 
of Rust (or even C++ concepts) already and are familiar with how blockchains work, but even if you do not have any specific background of Rust or Solana development, we will have all bases covered. If 
you have a high level of interest and motivation, we should be good to go ahead.

In this quest, we will be developing a simple calculator on the Solana blockchain. This essentially means that once you are done with this quest, you will be well versed with the basics of development on 
the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework and would be much better equipped to take on the other Solana quests.

## Setting up the Environment: 

There are a few things that we need to get up and running before we move forward in this quest. Before we move forward make sure you've a working NodeJS environment set up. We need rust, Solana, Mocha(a JS testing framework), Anchor and Phantom wallet for this quest.
To install rust, run
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
```

To install Solana, run
```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.0/install)"
```

To install mocha globally, run
```
npm install -g mocha
```

Now we'll be installing Anchor.
If you're on a linux system, run
```

npm i -g @project-serum/anchor-cli
```

**Fair Warning** : If you are using a Windows system, we highly suggest using [WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (Windows sub-system for Linux) or switching to a Linux environment. Setting up WSL is also quick and easy. A 
good walk-through can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3bPWl9Z2D0&ab_channel=BeachcastsProgrammingVideos)
For any other OS, you need to build from source. Run the following command
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.17.0 anchor-cli --locked
```

To verify that Anchor is installed, run
```
anchor --version
```

Since Solana is still a pretty new blockchain compared to the establised ones out there, it's developer tooling too is pretty limited and cumbersome as of now. However, it is rapidly improving 
and it does so on a daily basis. At the forefront of this development is Anchor, by [Armani Ferrante](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante). You can think of it like the Ruby on Rails framework for
Ruby, that means yes, you can develop things on vanilla Ruby, but Ruby on Rails makes your life much much easier, right? That's the same with Anchor and Solana development. Anchor is the Hardhat of 
Solana development plus much more. It offers a Rust DSL (basically, an easier Rust) to work with along with IDL, CLI and workspace management. Anchor abstracts away a lot of potential security holes
from a conventional Solana program, takes care of the serialization and deserialization, reduces large boilder-platey code to macros and lot of other good good stuff.

## Running configurations on Solana CLI

The first command you should run on your terminal (assuming Solana CLI was properly installed in the last quest) is:

```
solana config get
```

This should throw up a result similar to something like: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142705905-e5197e57-144d-4b17-b91c-a5d725b7e128.png)

If you didnot set up your keypair earlier, then you won't be having the `Keypair Path` in your results. To set that up, follow the instructions over [here](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/paper-wallet#seed-phrase-generation)

We would want to remain on the local network for building our program and later shift to the devent or mainnet-beta if required. If the `RPC URL` field of your last result did not show `localhost`, you can set it to localhost using the following command:

```
solana config set --url localhost
```

Next, we would want to know our account/wallet address and airdrop some SOL tokens into it, to handle all the deployment, transactions etc costs that come with interacting with and using a Solana program. To do that first let's find our address. The command to do that is:
```
solana address
```

This would result into something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142705948-017553ae-593e-4c2f-ae75-b12d0ab7e9a2.png)

Next, we want to spin up our local network. Think of this local network as a mock Solana blockchain running on your own single system. This network would be required for development and testing of our program. To spin it up, in a separate tab, use the following command:
```
solana-test-validator
```

Once you get an image, like the one below, you know that your local validator (local network) is now up and running

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142706030-6c3ad079-f69c-4be7-9221-a476c11cc1d0.png)

Then, for more comprehensive details of your account, use the following command with the address that you got from the last command
```
solana account <your address from the last command>
```

This would result into something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142706018-f78f61c9-e22e-43a4-8ff6-da8d9e344606.png)


Now, our last task is to top up our account with some SOL, which you can do by using:

```
solana airdrop 100
```

This should result in something like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142706066-032212f7-5ed2-4f03-b22a-e28a581ad0a3.png)

## Setting up our Anchor project

In this sub-quest all we would do is initialize an Anchor project and see whether everything's there and working fine or not and after move on ahead to make our own changes.
Head over to your preferred destination for the project using your terminal and then type the following command:
```
anchor init mycalculatordapp

cd mycalculatordapp
``` 

This would result in a screen somewhat similar to this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142706138-4b093910-3bba-4277-99b4-cedaae0b0dc1.png)

First we check whether we can see the *programs*, *app*, *programs*, *migrations* directory among others or not. If we can, we would head over to *programs/mycalculatordapp/src/lib.rs* to see the default program that Anchor provides us. This is the most basic example possible on Anchor and what's happening here is simply that a user-defined function `Initialize` whenever called would successfully exit the program. That's all, nothing fancy. Now, let's try to compile this program using the following command:

```
anchor build
```
if you get an error `consider adding cargo-features = ["edition2021"] to the manifest` then update solana:  
`solana-install update`

This would trigger a build function and would something like this upon completion:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142706255-54bf2239-5f20-48bb-8faf-29a10700a70d.png)

This build creates a new folder in your project directory called, `target`. This `target` folder contains the `idl` directory, which would also contain the `idl` for our program. The `IDL` or Interface Description Language describes the instructions exposed by the contract and is very similar to ABI in Solidity and user for similar purposes, ie, for tests and front-end integrations. Next, we can move onto testing this program, so that we can get familiar with how testing is done in Anchor. Head to `tests/messengerapp.js`. Here, you'll see a test written in javascript to interact and test the default program. There are a lot of things in the test, that may not make sense to you right now, but stick around and we'll get to those shortly. The test would look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142706288-ca3047bf-fe58-402c-80b6-955b07afd29f.png)

Next, to actually run these tests, first head over to the tab where you ran the solana-test-validator command and kill that process (using Ctrl-C). Now, use the following command:

```
anchor test
```

The passing tests should result in the following screen:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142706337-6133d6b2-4aee-46b7-a467-4e22567ea78a.png)

Now, let's head over to the `programs` directory and start importing some cool Rust crates provided by Anchor which will help us build our calculator app.

## Defining our programs

Head over to `programs/mycalculatordapp/src/lib.rs` and clear the code written there apart from the boilerplate code written over there. After clearing, your coding screen should look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142734480-8e60e4e7-d2a9-405d-87e9-ebde863875cd.png)

You can also copy paste the below code to get started (assuming that you've also named your project as `mycalculatordapp`)
```
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod mycalculatordapp {
    use super::*;
    
}
```

Now let us simply define the function signatures that we will require to code up our calculator dapp without writing the logic yet. The bulk of the program goes in a module under the `#[program]` macro. We'll just define them under the `pub mod mycalculatordapp` and write the logic later. These function definitions would look like this:

```
    pub fn create(ctx:Context<Create>, init_message: String) -> ProgramResult {

    }

    pub fn add(ctx: Context<Addition>, num1: i64, num2: i64) -> ProgramResult {

    }

    pub fn multiply(ctx: Context<Multiplication>, num1: i64, num2: i64) -> ProgramResult {

    }

    pub fn subtract(ctx: Context<Subtraction>, num1: i64, num2: i64) -> ProgramResult {

    }

    pub fn divide(ctx: Context<Division>, num1: i64, num2: i64) -> ProgramResult {

    }
```

Here `pub` means public and `fn` means function, implying that they are public functions that can be invoked from our program, ie it becomes a client-callable program function. The first argument of these functions is always `Context<T>` which consist of the solana accounts array and the program ID, which in essence is the required data to call just about any progarm on Solana. The next parameter of both the first function is a `String` named init_message, which we will be using as our message that is stored on our calculator (think how you see some text every time you boot up your phone, pc, calculator etc). In the other functions, the `num1` and `num2` parameters are of type integers and are the numbers on which we will be performing our mathematical operations. The `ProgramResult` is the return type of both these functions, which actually is just an easier method to serve function results and/or errors.

After defining the above functions, your code should look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142736063-8d8b3f80-c4df-475c-9734-e1426affdc10.png)

## Writing the logic for our first Solana program

Now let's write the logic for the `create` function first, ok? Let's first make our intentions clear for this function and the program in general. We want to keep track of three things here. First is the greeting message that we would be storing in our calculator, the second would be the result of all the mathematical operations and third is the remainder, which will be used in case of division, since Anchor currently does not support floating values. So we would want our calculator account (the main account that will handle all the calculation stuff of the program) to have three fields, namely: `greeting`, `result`, `remainder`. Also, since the same account will be used for the calculations and with different parameteres, we would want the calculator account to be mutable, ie, to be able to persist changes. Write the following code logic inside the `create` function now.

```
        let calculator = &mut ctx.accounts.calculator;
        calculator.greeting = init_message;
        Ok(())

```

The `Ok(())` syntax is used for error handling of the ProgramResult type. You can think of `Ok(())` like a gate, that lets the program continue if there are no errors but sends the program into another state if an error is encountered.  

Now, your coding screen should look something like this: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142736026-a0313568-7e60-4601-9d6e-a08bbecb8779.png)

## A small note about accounts on Solana
An account is not actually a wallet. Instead, it’s a way for the contract to persist data between calls. This includes information such as the count in our base_account, and also information about permissions on the account. Accounts pay rent in the form of lamports, and if it runs out, then the account is purged from the blockchain. Accounts with two years worth of rent attached are “rent-exempt” and can stay on the chain forever.

## Defining the structure of calculator account

In the last sub-quest, we talked about what is our expectation with the calculator account, right? Also, we used the calculator account already in the `create` function. So, now let's go ahead and define what actually our calculator account is. As mentioned earlier, everything on Solana is an account, so we will be using the awesome macros of Anchor to convert a struct into our calculator account. 

Write the code provided below outside of `pub mod mycalculatordapp`.
```
#[account]
pub struct Calculator {
    pub greeting: String,
    pub result: i64,
    pub remainder: i64,
}
```

With this, your code screen would look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142736006-ddbc11b0-1d98-43a3-928f-2171eb28f347.png)


Good, now you are on track to implement actual functionalities of a calculator. Let's see how do we do that.

## First calculation function logic

With the last sub-quest, we are all set to write the logic for our first calculation function. Let's write the logic for addition first. As you might be thinking, here we simply have to save the result of the addition of the two parameters in the `result` field of the calculator account. If you were thinking along that lines, then congratulations, you're right on the money. Write the following code inside of the `add` function

```
        let calculator = &mut ctx.accounts.calculator;
        calculator.result = num1 + num2;
        Ok(())

```

With this, your coding screen would look something like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142735765-d2513af9-5e5f-4d85-8ed0-c66862f4fbe9.png)

Notice the `Context<Addition`? As discussed earlier, it is the list of accounts that must be passed to this particular function for it to run. What accounts do you think would we require to send to this function to make it work? Yes, correct, we only need to send the calculator account, nothing else xD. So, now with this knowledge, let's define `Addition`, write the following code below with your declaration of the calculator account:

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Addition<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub calculator: Account<'info, Calculator>,
}
```

With this, your coding screen would look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142735894-c6eafac8-c69b-4e56-bf18-c01168bbc964.png)

Congratulations.... now you have a Solana blockchain program that is capable of adding two number.... How cool is that, right? Now I want you to take a pause and re-collect whatever you've learnt in the quest uptil now, because the next sub-quest is going to be a challenge sub-quest :D

## Challenge sub-quest

This sub-quest is a challenge for you. Trust me, at this moment, you are perfectly capable to write more Solana code by yourself. Keep in mind how we defined the `add` function and the `Addition` struct in the last quest and with that knowledge, I want you all to write the code for all the remaining functions, that is, `multiply`, `subtract` and `divide` and then declare the corresponding structs, that is `Multiplication`, `Subtraction` and `Division`. 

The only function that will be slightly different would be the `divide` function, so trust in yourself and give this sub-quest your best shot.

## Solution to the challenge sub-quest

I hope that you did your best to try and complete the remaining functions, now you can tally them with the below code.

The code for the `multiply` function is as follows:
```
        let calculator = &mut ctx.accounts.calculator;
        calculator.result = num1 * num2;
        Ok(())
```

The `Multiplication` struct would look something like this:

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Multiplication<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub calculator: Account<'info, Calculator>,
}
```

The code for the `subtract` function is as follows:
```
        let calculator = & mut ctx.accounts.calculator;
        calculator.result = num1 - num2;
        Ok(())
```

The code for `Subtraction` struct is as follows:
```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Subtraction<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub calculator: Account<'info, Calculator>,
}
```

And finally, the code for the `divide` function is as follows:

```
        let calculator = &mut ctx.accounts.calculator;
        calculator.result = num1 / num2;
        calculator.remainder = num1 % num2;
        Ok(())
```

The `Division` struct also looks like this

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Division<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub calculator: Account<'info, Calculator>,
}
```

With all this, your coding screen should look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142736456-bbc7f833-a2be-41b1-bc90-234c24d0d5bb.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142736470-3acd524d-d3db-483d-badf-e46963a07107.png)

Did you get them right, or most of them right or even one right? Wasn't this exciting? You're able to write Solana code yourself right off the bat. 

Now, is our program complete? Sadly no, there is one more, last remaining piece of the puzzle that we must address before we can say that we done with the program coding part. Before jumping onto the next sub-quest, try and guess what could we be missing from our program, and yes, you can guess that. It is within your grasp.

## Final piece of the puzzle

If you could guess that we had used the `Create` struct in the first `create` function itself but never defined it anywhere like we defined the `Addition`, `Multiplication` etc structs, then, congratulations you were absolutely right.

With this struct, we want to pass three accounts, the first is obviously the calculator account, since it is being used in the function itself. The second account is the user account and the third account is the system_program. What makes this struct a bit more special is that, in this struct we have to give the command to actually create the calculator account (which we have used in the subsequent functions). The creation of this calculator account will cost us some money (SOL) which will be paid by the `user` account that we just mentioned, along with that we have the space parameter where we specify how much space do we require in our account (here, calculator account) and finally the `system_program` is just system specifications for the Solana blockchain, again in the form of an account.

Write the following code to define the `Create` struct:

```
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Create<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 64)]
    pub calculator: Account<'info, Calculator>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

As discussed earlier, we used the derive Accounts macro since we had to incorporate 3 accounts here and for all these three accounts individually, we used the account macro. Now onto the arguments used with these macros. The `init` macro is used to create a new account owned by the current program which is our `mycalculatordapp` program. Whenever `init` parameter is used, we must always specify the `payer` or the account that will be paying for creation of the account on the Solana blockchain, along with the `space` param which is the space with which the new account is created.

The `mut` parameter marks an account as mutable, which essentially means our account will be altered and Solana will need to update the data in your account. So, always use the `mut` parameter for persisting changes. 

Another new concept used here is the `Signer` type. This is used to enforce the constraint that the `authority` account (messengerapp in this case) *signed* the transaction. 

With this, your coding screen should look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142736771-62624164-35ab-4aa0-b31d-4c5f8dabbaf0.png)

## Further reading:
You can read up on different types of account constraints [here](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/0.18.0/anchor_lang/derive.Accounts.html).

## Testing our calculator program

Head over to `tests/mycalculatordapp.js` and delete everything that's written there. We are going to be writing our tests from scratch. The first step would be to import the necessary libraries and constants. To do that, use the following code:

```
const assert = require('assert');
const anchor = require('@project-serum/anchor');
const { SystemProgram } = anchor.web3;
```

Now, since we will be using `Mocha` for testing our programs, we will create the skeleton of where we will be putting our tests. So, basically, how Mocha works is that it takes `describe` blocks as testing blocks and within those `describe` blocks there are numerous tests written using the `it` blocks. So, use the following code to create the skeleton:

```
describe('mycalculatordapp', () => {
  const provider = anchor.Provider.local();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const calculator = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();
  const program = anchor.workspace.Mycalculatordapp;

  it('Creates a calculator', async () => {

  });

  it("Adds two numbers", async function() {

  });

  it('Multiplies two numbers', async function() {

  })

  it('Subtracts two numbers', async function() {

  });

  it('Divides two numbers', async function() {

  });
});
```
With this, your code screen should look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142736973-a4a89e29-9e5f-40c5-82fd-924e2e81d1f7.png)

The additional things that we coded there were the introduction of `provider`. The `provider` is the abstraction of a connection to the Solana network. In the test, the Anchor framework will create the provider for us based on the environment `(anchor.Provider.local())`.

Now, the `program` is an abstraction that combines the Provider, idl, and the programID (which is generated when the program is built) and allows us to call RPC methods against our program.

The calculator variable you see is the keypair generated using anchor.web3 that we will be using to test our program.

When we have these three things, we can start calling functions in our program, which is what we will be doing in our next sub-quest.

## Writing our first test

The method to call the functions of our program is pretty straight-forward. We will use the program RPCs (Remote procedure calls) to access the function and then we will use the `web3.js` library to create `accounts` which have to be passed as the parameters to those functions. Let's first jump into the code of our first test and see things in action.

```
  it('Creates a calculator', async () => {
    await program.rpc.create("Welcome to Solana", {
      accounts: {
        calculator: calculator.publicKey,
        user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
      },
      signers: [calculator]
    });

    const account = await program.account.calculator.fetch(calculator.publicKey);
    assert.ok(account.greeting === "Welcome to Solana");
    _calculator = calculator;
  });
```
Now, what we have done in the code above is simply create a `calculator` account by generating a new account using the `web3` library. Then using the program RPC, we have called the `create` function and to that function we have supplied the required parameters, which were the `calculator`, `user`, `systemProgram` and the `init_message` string.

After this function is run, we simply grabbed hold of the calculator account and checked it's `greeting` field and verify whether it has changed to `Welcome to Solana` or not. After that we save the calculator account in a variable called `_calculator` so that it can be referenced later.

With this, your code screen would look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142737192-b30cfe3e-905c-46f7-9cfd-457d7e4f0f05.png)

## Writing our second test

With this second test, we begin testing the calculations of the Solana program that we wrote. Firstly, we will write the test for the correct functioning of the `add` function and then with that as the inspiration, the next sub-quest will be a challenge sub-quest where the learner will write the tests for `multiply`, `subtract` and `divide`. For testing, we cannot directly use numbers and we will therefore have to cast them into Anchor big numbers. Now, write the code below to test the `add` function of our `mycalculatordapp` program.

```
  it("Adds two numbers", async function() {
    const calculator = _calculator;
    
    await program.rpc.add(new anchor.BN(2), new anchor.BN(3), {
      accounts: {
        calculator: calculator.publicKey,
      },
    });

    const account = await program.account.calculator.fetch(calculator.publicKey);
    assert.ok(account.result.eq(new anchor.BN(5)));
    assert.ok(account.greeting === "Welcome to Solana");
  });
```
It is very similar to the test we wrote in the last sub-quest with the only changes being that we are supplying *2* and *3* as the numbers to be added and passing the list of accounts as per the `Addition` struct which requires only the `calculator` account. After the `add` function is run using the RPC, we fetch the calculator account and check the fields of the calculator account. The `greeting` field should remain unaffected and still be "Welcome to Solana", along with that the result field should now be equal to the sum of 2 and 3, ie, 5. 

That is all that was required to test the `add` function. With this, your coding screen should look like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32522659/142737483-fff0e04d-3abf-414c-a44d-20b487b38d05.png)

## Challenge sub-quest

As discussed in the previous sub-quest, in this sub-quest you are required to come up with the tests for the `multiply`, `subtract` and `divide` functions by yourself. You can take inspiration from the earlier two tests we wrote and trust me when I say that you can very easily write the tests for these three functions too. All you need to do is make sure that the entire quest uptil this point was clear to you.

All the best.

## Solution to the challenge sub-quest

I hope that you gave your best attempt to the challenge in the last sub-quest and now let's tally what you've written with the tests can be. The values of the parameters (num1 and num2) being passed can change, make sure you are writing your `assert` statements accordingly.

Here's the code for the `multiply` function check:

```
  it('Multiplies two numbers', async function() {
    const calculator = _calculator;

    await program.rpc.multiply(new anchor.BN(2), new anchor.BN(3), {
      accounts: {
        calculator: calculator.publicKey,
      },
    });

    const account = await program.account.calculator.fetch(calculator.publicKey);
    assert.ok(account.result.eq(new anchor.BN(6)));
    assert.ok(account.greeting === "Welcome to Solana");
  })

```
Here's the code for the `subtract` function check:

```
  it('Subtracts two numbers', async function() {
    const calculator = _calculator;

    await program.rpc.subtract(new anchor.BN(32), new anchor.BN(33), {
      accounts: {
        calculator: calculator.publicKey,
      },
    });

    const account = await program.account.calculator.fetch(calculator.publicKey);
    assert.ok(account.result.eq(new anchor.BN(-1)));
    assert.ok(account.greeting === "Welcome to Solana");
  });

```

Here's the code for the `divide` function check:

```
  it('Divides two numbers', async function() {
    const calculator = _calculator;

    await program.rpc.divide(new anchor.BN(10), new anchor.BN(3), {
      accounts: {
        calculator: calculator.publicKey,
      },
    });

    const account = await program.account.calculator.fetch(calculator.publicKey);
    assert.ok(account.result.eq(new anchor.BN(3)));
    assert.ok(account.remainder.eq(new anchor.BN(1)));
    assert.ok(account.greeting === "Welcome to Solana");
  });
```

Wasn't this exhilarating? You've only just started with Solana development and now not only can you just write program functions on your own, you can also write tests to verify their functioning. Isn't this seriously mind-blowing? Anyway, congratulations on this feet and just tally your code with the code snapshot below and after which we move onto actaully running these tests.

## Running the tests

Now, that we are done running all the tests, make sure that your local validator is not running. That means make sure that the `solana-test-validator` process is not running and the `network` is set as localhost by inspecting the results of `solana config get`. Once all this is done, it is time for us to actually test the progarm that we wrote. To do that use the following command:

```
anchor test
```

If all the tests pass, you'll get a screen similar to this:

If you get some errors, try debugging those using the error messages you get. Make sure you have accurately followed the code presented in the quests and you are on the same Anchor version as that followed in the quest (0.17.0). With that you'll find your way out of most of the errors that you might run into.

## Congratulations

Congratulations on succesfully creating your own calculator on the Solana blockchain and testing its functioning :D 

## Next steps
Now you've dipped your toes in the ocean of Solana development. To learn more about it, you can try and mess around with the data types that we used in the function declarations and see what effect does that have on the program; you can try to use just one struct in place of the `Addition`, `Multiplication`, `Subtraction` and `Division` struct since they were all similar. You can try to combine all the four calculator functions into one function where the operation is decided using the parameter passed, and apart from this you can experiment with the contents of this quest to your heart's content and then you can move onto the other quests on Solana development. **You can also proceed to [Layer3](https://alpha.layer3.xyz/task/create-a-calculator-using-rust-programs) and claim your NFT reward for succesfully completing this quest!**
